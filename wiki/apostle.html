            The association of hierarchy in general (and apostleship in particular) with humiliation is undeniable. These apostles, will have to drink Jesus' cup. It's not a cup given to him by slaves in soft clothing. It's a cup he drinks naked, beard ripped out, with spit on his face. Apostles are modeled to have a larger share of this cup of suffering/humiliation.
