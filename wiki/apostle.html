            The association of hierarchy in general (and apostleship in particular) with humiliation is undeniable. These apostles, will have to drink Jesus' cup. It's not a cup given to him by slaves in soft clothing. It's a cup he drinks naked, beard ripped out, with spit on his face. Apostles are modeled to have a larger share of this cup of suffering/humiliation.

    <p class="exegesis">This occurrence of humility in 1 Peter actually demonstrates the role of humility in stirring up grace, but also highlights humility's function within hierarchy.</p>
    <blockquote>
        5 In the same way, younger men, be subject to the elders, and all of you clothe yourselves with <strong>humility</strong> toward one another, because God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the <strong> humble</strong>. 6 <strong>Humble</strong> yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you at the right time, 7 casting all your cares on him, because ⌊he cares⌋ for you. <cite>1 Peter 5:5–7 (LEB)</cite>

    <li>
       The weakest in a local church should be able to acknowledge with sincerity that the apostle is the biggest slave, and to enumerate the ways that the apostle serves (slaves for) his or her interests.
