            17 But in giving this instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. 18 For in the first place, when you* come together as a church, I hear there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. 19 For indeed it is necessary that there be factions among you, in order that those who are approved may become evident among you. 20 Therefore, when* you come together in the same place, it is not <strong> to eat the Lord’s supper</strong>. 21 For when you* eat it, each one of you goes ahead <strong>to take his own supper</strong>, and one is hungry and another is drunk. 22 For do you not have houses for eating and drinking? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who do not have anything? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you!
            23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and after he* had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 25 Likewise also the cup, after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. 27 So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. 28 But let a person examine himself, and in this way let him eat from the bread and let him drink from the cup. 29 For the one who eats and drinks, if he* does not recognize the body, eats and drinks judgment against himself. 30 Because of this, many are weak and sick among you, and quite a few ⌊have died⌋. 31 But if we were evaluating ourselves, we would not be judged. 32 But if we* are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined, in order that we will not be condemned with the world.
            33 So then, my brothers, <strong>when you* come together in order to eat the Lord’s supper</strong>,* wait for one another. 34 If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And I will give directions about the remaining matters whenever I come.

    Here are the traditions surrounding contributions to the love feast.

<div class="tradition structure-content">
         <ol class="tradition structure-content">
             <li>
                 There will be no monetization/fund for shabbat feast contributions.
             </li>
             <li>
                 Partaking in the love feast is an opportunity to practice being hospitable and fulfill Hebrews 13. So be in the pattern of being mindful to contribute dishes and food to the love feast if it is in your hand to do it.
             </li>
             <li>
                   Another practice that we encourage is to find someone who is spiritually gifted in hospitality/service <strong>OR</strong> imitable through maturity in hospitality/service to prepare something in your stead, and then give that person alms.
