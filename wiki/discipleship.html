            16 So the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated for them. 17 And when they* saw him, they worshiped him,* but some doubted. 18 And Jesus approached and* spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore, <strong>go* and* make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age.</strong>”

            Therefore what should you do, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a

<p class="tradition">We have diverse traditions based on our exegesis of the above doctrine. :</p>
<ol class="tradition structure-content">
    <li>
        You can literally "bring a psalm" as a contribution. This can look like just opening your bible and reading a psalm to the body.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can bring a prepared and/or well-known psalm/hymn and sing this at the gathering. You can sing alone or lead the body in the song.
    </li>
    <li>
        Under inspiration from the Spirit, you can break into a song as led by Spirit; this would just be for the body's reception (although, it would be really cool if the Holy Spirit put the <strong>same song</strong> into multiple people's hearts.
