            16 So the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated for them. 17 And when they* saw him, they worshiped him,* but some doubted. 18 And Jesus approached and* spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore, <strong>go* and* make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age.</strong>”

            Qualifications for Overseers
            3 The saying is trustworthy: if anyone aspires to supervision, he desires a good work. 2 Therefore the overseer must be irreproachable, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, skillful in teaching, 3 not addicted to wine, not a violent person, but gentle, peaceable, not loving money, 4 managing his own household well, having children in submission with all dignity 5 (but if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?), 6 not newly converted, lest he become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the devil. 7 But he must also have a good testimony from those outside, in order that he may not fall into disgrace and the trap of the devil.

            Qualifications for Deacons
            8 Deacons likewise must be dignified, not insincere, not devoted to much wine, not fond of dishonest gain, 9 holding the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience, 10 and these also must be tested first; then let them serve if they* are above reproach. 11 The wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderous, temperate, faithful in all things. 12 Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. 13 For those who have served well acquire a good standing for themselves, and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.

            The Mystery of Godliness Described
            14 I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you in a short time. 15 But if I am delayed, I am writing* in order that you may know how one must conduct oneself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and mainstay of the truth. 16 And most certainly, great is the mystery of godliness:

            Who was revealed in the flesh,
            was vindicated by the Spirit,
            was seen by angels,
            was proclaimed among the Gentiles,
            was believed on in the world,
            was taken up in glory.

<h5 class="tradition structure-heading">Tradition</h5>
<p class="tradition">We have diverse traditions based on our exegesis of the above doctrine. :</p>
<ol class="tradition structure-content">
    <li> We instruct that there are two general types of discipleship : narrow and broad</li>
    <li>We instruct that discipleship is necessary for all followers (read disciples) of Jesus of Nazareth.</li>
    <li>A biblical discipling relationship entails responsibility and submission; i.e. the discipler assumes responsibility for the disciple, and the disciple submits to the discipler. </li>
    <li>We instruct that the discipler meet with the disciple at least once a week for discipleship. </li>
    <li>We instruct that discipleship should entail disciples pursuing elder (for men) and eldress (for women) qualifications; (i.e. read "maturity" qualifications).</li>
    <li>We instruct that all disciples should be on the trajectory to replicate what is entrusted to them by turning and discipling others.</li>
    <li>We instruct that all disciples, in pursuit of their ultimate rabbi's will and in the context of discipleship, should seek to use, exercise, and grow the "measure(s) of grace" and spiritual gifts given to them.</li>
    <li>The goal of discipleship is to become more and more conformed to the image of Jesus the Messiah within all of our contexts and calling.</li>
