            8 All of the people gathered as one to the <strong>public square</strong> before the Water Gate. They asked
            Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses that Yahweh had commanded Israel. 2 <strong>So Ezra
            the priest brought the law before the assembly for each man and woman to hear with understanding</strong>,
            on the first day of the seventh month. 3 He <strong>read from it facing the public square</strong> before
            the Water Gate from dawn until noon that day, opposite the men, women, and those with understanding.
            <strong>The ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law</strong>. 4 Then Ezra the scribe
            stood on a wooden podium that had been made for the occasion. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema,
            Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right. On his left was Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum,
            Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. 5 Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, because he
            was above all of the people. When he opened it all the people stood up. 6 Then Ezra blessed Yahweh the great
            God, and all of the people answered, “Amen! Amen!” while lifting their hands. Then they bowed down and
            worshiped Yahweh with their noses to the ground. 7 And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai,
            Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites were teaching the people from
            the law while the people were in their places. 8 So they read the book from the law of God, making it clear
            and giving the meaning so that they could understand the reading.

The use of the verb ἐκκλησιάζω (to hold an assembly) is fitting. This is the verb used to create a gathering/assembly, or as the LXX translates it: an

    <a href="#fn-ekklesia" rel="footnote"></a>
</sup> The linguistic choice of the LXX is echoed in the usage in the NT. The association between the "church/assembly" of God's people <strong>AND</strong> the written Scriptures is ancient, preceding the birth of the Church by at least hundreds of years.

<h5 class="tradition structure-heading">Tradition</h5>
<p class="tradition">Here are some traditions surrounding public reading of Scripture :</p>
<ol class="tradition structure-content">
    <li>
       We read the Scriptures out loud in gathering on a yearly cycle. Our annual cycle currently includes the Torah, the Prophets, the New Testament, and the Psalms.
    </li>
    <li>
       We apply attentiveness to the public reading of the word by seeking to "minister to it," sitting at the feet of the Scriptures as Mary sat at the feet of Yeshua. In contradistinction to Mary, in <em>attending to</em> the public reading, whilst seeking the rest of Shabbat, we seek to NOT EMULATE Martha by avoiding kitchen/prep/food/cleaning work that is not to the direct and dire service of one of our weak (e.g. a toddler pee-peeing on the floor, someone spilling a drink on themselves, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>During the public reading, we enforce no particular posture, though many are encouraged (raising the palms, davaning, closing the eyes, standing <strong>anything that engages the listener with the text</strong>, etc.). </li>
    <li>In orbiting the weakest among us, the children and the disabled, we encourage
        <ul>
            <li><strong>creative postures</strong> (e.g. sitting in lap, laying, holding the weak and pacing/moving etc), </li>
            <li><strong>doodling activities</strong> (e.g. drawing book, doodling, color books, etc), </li>
            <li><strong>special seating</strong> (e.g. quiet rocking chair, lounging in comfy bean bag, using a yoga mat, etc.)</li>

                ἐκκλησία (ekklēsia). n. fem. church, assembly, congregation. A group that meets together for various political, religious, and civic purposes.
                In Graeco-Roman culture, an ekklēsia referred to a political assembly. The Septuagint uses the term to translate the Hebrew word קָהָל (qāhāl), which means “assembly” or “congregation” and often refers to Israel’s religious gatherings. The NT use of ekklēsia reflects both of these uses of the term, though it probably deliberately applies the image of Israel’s congregation to the gathering of believers. In the NT the term can refer to a local or universal body of Christians. On the whole, Acts uses the term to denote a local community comprising those who embraced the gospel preached by early Christian missionaries (e.g., Acts 9:31). During the conflict of Paul and the Ephesian artisans, this council is referred to as an ekklēsia (Acts 19:32, 39, 40).
                The term is rarely used in the gospels (Matt 16:18; 18:17), but is fundamental to the imagery and theology of the letters in the NT. Paul uses ekklēsia in the universal, regional, and local sense of the term. It is a place where the “saints” gather (1 Cor 14:33; 16:1; 2 Cor 1:1) and is itself sanctified (1 Cor 1:2). It is a gathering where the spiritual gifts of the members are demonstrated (1 Cor 12–14) and financial support for the universal body of believers is collected (Rom 16:1; 2 Cor 8–9). In a universal sense, it is regarded as the “bride” of the Messiah (Eph 5:25) and the body (or flesh) of the Messiah (Eph 1:22, 23; 5:23, 29; Col 1:18, 24). In 1 Timothy, the church has the specific nuance of a larger household, charged with caring for the social outcasts (e.g., 1 Tim 3:5, 15; 5:16). Revelation uses the term exclusively to refer to the seven churches in the region of Asia.
