<p class="synopsis lead">
    I am the TLDR for contributions
</p>
<h2 id="contributions-background">Overview</h2>
<p>The background of contributions is rooted in the Sabbath gathering. We believe that Paul's directives regarding the
    weekly assembling of believers are universal mandates for the church. Paul had an order for the gathering based on
    the synagogue order of service. The gathering is communal and very loose in terms of it's chronological order and
    structural limits. What is clear is that the purpose of gathering was to bring a contribution for the purpose of
    building up the church. The church is a spiritual house for the Holy Spirit to live in, so the contributions have to
    be spiritual contributions. So each believer, being uniquely equipped with the spiritual gifts they received from
    the Holy Spirit, is expected to come prepared to contribute something to edify, build up, the church.</p>

        You can literally "bring a psalm" as a contribution. This can look like just opening your bible and reading a psalm to the body.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can bring a prepared and/or well-known psalm/hymn and sing this at the gathering. You can sing alone or lead the body in the song.
    </li>
    <li>
        Under inspiration from the Spirit, you can break into a song as led by Spirit; this would just be for the body's reception (although, it would be really cool if the Holy Spirit put the <strong>same song</strong> into multiple people's hearts.

            16 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel whom you know are elders of the people and their officials; take them to the tent of assembly, and they will stand there with you. 17 I will come down and speak with you there; I will <strong>take away from the spirit that is on you</strong>, and I will <strong>place it on them</strong>; and they will <strong>bear the burdens of the people with you</strong>; you will not bear it alone.

            <br/>
            <strong>...</strong>
            <br/>

            24 So Moses went out, and he spoke the words of Yahweh to the people, and he gathered together seventy men from the elders of the people, and he ⌊made them stand⌋ all around the tent. 25 Then Yahweh went down in the cloud and spoke to him, and he took away the spirit that was on him, and he ⌊put it⌋ on the seventy elders. <strong>And as soon as the spirit was resting on them they prophesied</strong>, but they did not do it again.
            26 But two men were left in the camp; the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the second was Medad, and <strong>the spirit rested on them</strong>; they were among those who were written down, but they did not go out to the tent, <strong>so they prophesied in the camp</strong>. 27 So a boy ran and told Moses and said, “Eldad and Medad are <strong>prophesying</strong> in the camp.” 28 And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from time of his youth, answered, “Moses, my lord, stop them.” 29 But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? <strong>Would that he give all Yahweh’s people prophets, that Yahweh put his spirit on them</strong>!” 30 Then Moses and the elders of Israel were gathered to the camp.
