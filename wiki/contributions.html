  I am the TLDR for contributions

<h2 id="contributions-background">Overview</h2>
<p>The background of contributions is rooted in the Sabbath gathering. We believe that Paul's directives regarding the weekly assembling of believers are universal mandates for the church. Paul had an order for the gathering based on the synagogue order of service. The gathering is communal and very loose in terms of it's chronological order and structural limits. What is clear is that the purpose of gathering was to bring a contribution for the purpose of building up the church. The church is a spiritual house for the Holy Spirit to live in, so the contributions have to be spiritual contributions. So each believer, being uniquely equipped with the spiritual gifts they received from the Holy Spirit, is expected to come prepared to contribute something to edify, build up, the church.</p>
