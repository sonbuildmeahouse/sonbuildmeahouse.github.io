            12.1 <strong>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.</strong> 2 You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the speechless idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed,” and no one is able to say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit.
            4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit, 5 and there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord, 6 and there are varieties of activities, but the same God, who works all things in all people. 7 But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is beneficial to all. 8 For to one is given a word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another a word of knowledge by the same Spirit, 9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 10 to another ⌊miraculous powers⌋, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing of spirits, to another kinds of tongues, to another interpretation of tongues. 11 But in all these things one and the same Spirit is at work, distributing to each one individually just as he wishes.


            12 For just as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, although they* are many, are one body, thus also Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free persons, and all were made to drink one Spirit. 14 For the body is not one member, but many. 15 If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” not because of this is it not a part of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body, not because of this is it not a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body just as he wanted. 19 And if they all were one member, where would the body be? 20 But now there are many members, but one body.
            21 Now the eye is not able to say to the hand, “I do not have need of you,” or again, the head to the feet, “I do not have need of you.” 22 But by much more the members of the body which are thought to be weaker are necessary, 23 and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor, and our unpresentable parts come to have more abundant presentability, 24 but our presentable parts do not have need of this. Yet God composed the body by giving more abundant honor to the part which lacked it, 25 in order that there not be a division in the body, but the members would have the same concern for one another. 26 And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; if a member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
            27 Now you are the body of Christ, and members ⌊of it individually⌋, 28 and whom God has appointed in the church: first, apostles, second, prophets, third, teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, kinds of tongues. 29 Not all are apostles, are they?* Not all are prophets, are they?* Not all are teachers, are they?* Not all are workers of miracles, are they?* 30 Not all have gifts of healing, do they?* Not all speak with tongues, do they?* Not all interpret, do they?* 31 But strive for the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.


            13.1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a ringing brass gong or a clashing cymbal. 2 And if I have the gift of prophecy and I know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 And if I parcel out all my possessions, and if I hand over my body in order that I will be burned, but do not have love, it benefits me nothing.
            4 Love is patient, love is kind, love is not jealous, it does not boast, it does not become conceited, 5 it does not behave dishonorably, it ⌊is not selfish⌋, it does not become angry, it does not keep a record of wrongs, 6 it does not rejoice at unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth, 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
            8 Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will pass away. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but whenever the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside the things of a child. 12 For now we see through a mirror ⌊indirectly⌋, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know completely, just as I have also been completely known. 13 And now these three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.


            14.1 Pursue love, and strive for spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. 2 For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, because no one understands, but by the Spirit he speaks mysteries. 3 But the one who prophesies speaks to people edification and encouragement and consolation. 4 The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. 5 Now I want you all to speak with tongues, but even more that you may prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, in order that the church may receive edification.
            6 But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, how do I benefit you, unless I speak to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching? 7 Likewise, the inanimate things which produce a sound, whether flute or lyre, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the lyre? 8 For indeed, if the trumpet produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare for battle? 9 And so you through the tongue, unless you produce a clear message, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air. 10 There are probably so many kinds of languages in the world, and none without meaning. 11 Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a barbarian to the one who is speaking, and the one who is speaking will be a barbarian in my judgment. 12 In this way also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek for the edification of the church, in order that you may abound.
            13 Therefore the one who speaks in a tongue must pray that he may interpret. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive. 15 ⌊Therefore what should I do⌋? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will also sing praise with my mind. 16 For otherwise, if you praise in your spirit, how will the one who fills the place of the outsider say the “amen” at your thanksgiving, because he does not know what you are saying? 17 For indeed you are giving thanks well, but the other person is not edified. 18 I give thanks to God that I speak with tongues more than all of you, 19 but in the church I prefer to speak five words with my mind, in order that I may instruct other people, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
            20 Brothers, do not become children in your understanding, but with respect to wickedness be as a child, and in your understanding be mature. 21 In the law it is written:

            “By those who speak a foreign language
            and by the lips of others
            I will speak to this people,
            and not even in this way will they obey me,”

            says the Lord. 22 So then, tongues are for a sign not to those who believe, but to unbelievers, but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe. 23 Therefore, if the whole church comes together at the same time and all speak with tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? 24 But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all, 25 the secret things of his heart become evident, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!”


            26 ⌊Therefore what should you do⌋, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. All things must be done for edification. 27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, it must be on one occasion two or at most three, and ⌊one after the other⌋, and one must interpret. 28 But if there is no interpreter, he must be silent in the church, but let him speak to himself and to God. 29 Let two or three prophets speak, and the others evaluate. 30 And if something is revealed to another who is seated, the first must be silent. 31 For you are all able to prophesy ⌊in turn⌋, in order that all may learn and all may be encouraged, 32 and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. 33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace.
            As in all the churches of the saints, 34 the women must be silent in the churches, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but they must be in submission, just as the law also says. 35 But if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. 36 Or has the word of God gone out from you, or has it come to you only?
            37 If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, he should recognize that the things which I am writing to you are of the Lord. 38 But if anyone ignores this, he is ignored. 39 So then, my brothers, desire to prophesy, and do not prevent speaking with tongues. 40 But let all things be done decently and according to proper procedure.

            1 Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to live in a manner worthy of the calling with which you were called: 2 with all humility and gentleness, with patience, putting up with one another in love, 3 being eager to <strong>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</strong>; 4 <strong>one body and one Spirit</strong> (just as also you were called with one hope of your calling), 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6 one God and Father of all, who is <strong>over all, and through all, and in all</strong>.

            7 Now <strong>to each one of us was given this grace, according to the measure of Christ’s gift</strong>. 8 Therefore it says,

            “Ascending on high he led captivity captive;
            <strong>he gave gifts to men</strong>.”

            9 Now “he ascended,” what is it, except that he also descended to the lower regions of the earth? 10 The one who descended himself is also the one who ascended above all the heavens, <strong>in order that he might fill all things</strong>.
            11 And <strong>he himself gave</strong> some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers 12 for the equipping of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for building up the body of Christ, 13 until we all reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to a measure of the maturity of the fullness of Christ, 14 so that we may no longer be infants, tossed about by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of people, by craftiness with reference to the scheming of deceit. 15 But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow into him with reference to all things, who is the head, Christ, 16 from whom the whole body, joined together and held together by every supporting ligament, according to the working by measure of each single part, the growth of the body makes for the building up of itself in love.

            12 Therefore I exhort you, brothers, through the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, so that you may approve what is the good and well-pleasing and perfect will of God.


            3 <strong>For by the grace given to me</strong> I say to everyone who is among you not to think more highly of yourself than what one ought to think, but to think ⌊sensibly⌋, <strong>as God has apportioned a measure of faith to each one</strong>. 4 For just as in one body we have many members, but all the members do not have the same function, 5 in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ, and ⌊individually⌋ members of one another, 6 <strong>but having different gifts according to the grace given to us</strong>: if it is prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith; 7 if it is service, by service; if it is one who teaches, by teaching; 8 if it is one who exhorts, by exhortation; one who gives, with sincerity; one who leads, with diligence; one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.

            68 For the music director. Of David. A psalm. A song.
            1 God will arise; his enemies will be scattered,
            and those who hate him will flee from before him.
            2 As smoke is driven off, you will drive them off.
            As wax melts before fire,
            the wicked will perish before God.
            3 But the righteous will be glad; they will exalt before God,
            and will rejoice with joy.
            4 Sing to God, sing praises to his name.
            Lift up a song to the rider on the clouds—his name is Yah—
            and rejoice before him.
            5 A father to orphans and a judge for widows
            is God in his holy habitation.
            6 God settles the lonely in a home;
            he brings prisoners out into prosperity.
            But the rebellious abide in a barren land.
            7 O God, when you went out before your people,
            when you marched through the desert, Selah
            8 the earth shook; the heavens also dripped rain
            at the presence of God who was at Sinai,
            at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
            9 You caused abundant rain to fall, O God.
            When your inheritance was weary you revived it.
            10 Your community dwelled in it.
            You provided in your goodness for the poor, O God.
            11 The Lord gives the word.
            Great is the company of women who announce:
            12 “The kings of armies flee, they flee,
            and she who remains at home divides the spoil.
            13 Though you men lie down between the sheepfolds,
            you will be like the wings of a dove covered in silver
            and its pinions in yellow gold.”
            14 When Shaddai scattered kings on it,
            on Zalmon it snowed.
            15 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;
            a mountain of many peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
            16 Why do you look with hostility, O many-peaked mountains?
            This mountain God desires for his dwelling.
            Yes, Yahweh will abide in it forever.
            17 The chariots of God
            are twice ten thousand, with thousands doubled.
            The Lord is among them at Sinai, distinctive in victory.
            18 You have ascended on high; you have led away captives.
            You have received gifts from among humankind,
            and even from the rebellious, so that Yah God may dwell there.
            19 Blessed be the Lord. Daily he loads us with benefits,
            the God of our salvation. Selah
            20 Our God is a God of deliverances,
            and to the Yahweh the Lord belong escapes from death.
            21 But God will shatter the head of his enemies,
            the hairy scalp of the one who ⌊continues on⌋ in his guilt.
            22 The Lord said, “I will bring them back from Bashan;
            I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,
            23 so that your foot may shatter them bloody
            for the tongues of your dogs to have their share from the enemies.”
            24 They have seen your processions, O God,
            the processions of my God, my king, distinctive in victory.
            25 Singers went up front, those playing stringed instruments last,
            between them young women playing tambourines.
            26 Bless God in the assemblies,
            Yahweh from the fountain of Israel.
            27 There is little Benjamin ruling them,
            with the princes of Judah in their throng,
            the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali.
            28 Your God has commanded your strength.
            Show yourself strong, O God, by what you perform for us.
            29 Because your temple is above Jerusalem,
            kings will bring tribute to you.
            30 Rebuke the beasts in the reeds,
            the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples,
            trampling the pieces of silver.
            Scatter the nations who delight in battles.
            31 Ambassadors will come from Egypt;
            Cush will quickly stretch out her hands to God.
            32 O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God;
            sing praise to the Lord, Selah
            33 to the one who rides in the highest heavens of old.
            See, he gives forth his voice, a mighty voice.
            34 Ascribe strength to God.
            His majesty is over Israel,
            and his strength is in the clouds.
            35 Awesome are you, O God, from your sanctuary.
            The God of Israel, it is he who gives strength and might to the people.
            Blessed be God.

            16 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel whom you know are elders of the people and their officials; take them to the tent of assembly, and they will stand there with you. 17 I will come down and speak with you there; I will <strong>take away from the spirit that is on you</strong>, and I will <strong>place it on them</strong>; and they will <strong>bear the burdens of the people with you</strong>; you will not bear it alone.

            26 But two men were left in the camp; the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the second was Medad, and <strong>the spirit rested on them</strong>; they were among those who were written down, but they did not go out to the tent, <strong>so they prophesied in the camp</strong>. 27 So a boy ran and told Moses and said, “Eldad and Medad are <strong>prophesying</strong> in the camp.” 28 And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from time of his youth, answered, “Moses, my lord, stop them.” 29 But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? <strong>Would that he give all Yahweh’s people prophets, that Yahweh put his spirit on them</strong>!” 30 Then Moses and the elders of Israel were gathered to the camp.
